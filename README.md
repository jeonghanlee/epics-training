# ALS-U EPICS Training Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the ALS-U EPICS Environment. This guide is designed to assist in developing and testing Input/Output Controllers (IOCs) for the Advanced Light Source Upgrade (ALS-U).

The training is designed with the ALS-U EPICS Environment. And this  environment is designed to **simplify** the development process, ensure code quality, and promote consistency across all ALS-U IOC projects. Furthermore, it aims to remove tedious and error-prone procedures often associated with traditional EPICS IOC development and deployment.

This documentation is built and published through our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, ensuring that you always have access to the latest information.
