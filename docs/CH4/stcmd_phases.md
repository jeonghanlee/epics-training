# IOC Startup Sequence (`st.cmd` Phases)

*(Content for this section will explain the significance of the `iocInit()` command in `st.cmd`. It will cover what kinds of commands are typically placed before `iocInit()` (e.g., loading hardware drivers, setting environment variables, configuring paths) and what happens after `iocInit()` (e.g., setting initial PV values, starting scan tasks, potentially running sequence programs).)*
